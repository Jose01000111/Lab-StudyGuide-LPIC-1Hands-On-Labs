## 🧠 Why I Made This LPIC-1 Lab Guide

I was spending too much time watching videos and reading without really learning. I kept jumping between courses and tabs labeled “LPIC-1 prep,” but with tiny know;edge gain. I wasn’t building the hands-on skills I needed.

So I stopped just studying and started doing.

I went through the official LPIC-1 exam objectives and built this guide as a way to actually practice what I was learning — one topic at a time, in the terminal.

## 🧪 What’s in Each Lab

Each lab focuses on a single LPIC-1 exam objective and includes:

- **What You’re Learning**  
  The exam objective and key knowledge areas.

- **Lab Instructions**  
  Step-by-step tasks to practice commands and concepts.

- **Main Commands and Files**  
  The important terms, files, and tools used in the lab.

- **Extras That Might Show Up**  
  Other useful commands or concepts related to the topic.

- **Study Notes**  
  A quick summary at the end of each lab to review what we worked on.
