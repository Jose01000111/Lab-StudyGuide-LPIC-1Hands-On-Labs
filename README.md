## 🧠 Why I Made This LPIC-1 Lab Guide
#### I was learning too slowly, spending most of my time passively listening to courses. While they’re helpful for understanding the scope of the material and getting key explanations, I realized I wasn’t truly building the skills I needed. A cybersecurity instructor once told me that one of the best ways to learn is to teach — so I decided to adopt that mindset. This guide is my way of doing that: working through the LPIC-1 objectives with hands-on labs, minimal course dependency, and clear write-ups to reinforce what I’ve learned by actually using the tools.

## 🎓 LPIC-1 Description
#### LPIC-1 is split into two separate exams, and they cover a lot. The first one (101-500) hits you with package management, file systems, and the command line. The second one (102-500) gets into things like shell scripting, networking, users, security, and system maintenance.
