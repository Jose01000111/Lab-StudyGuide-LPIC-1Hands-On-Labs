## 🧠 Why I Created This LPIC-1 Lab Guide

I found myself learning slowly — passively watching courses instead of truly building skills. Inspired by the idea that *“the best way to learn is to teach,”* I decided to build this guide to **learn by doing**.

This guide walks through **LPIC-1 exam objectives with hands-on labs**, minimal course reliance, and concise write-ups — reinforcing knowledge by directly using the tools.
